First post on _[The Grid][0]_.

It's Wednesday, December 16, 2016\. 

My number came up as next in line to be granted access to a new company that will help me create a website with the assistance of artificial intelligence. 64,000 other nerds have signed up. I've never been accused of being much of a geek...but the premise of The Grid has me pretty stoked, intrigued, and even a little apprehensive. 

So cheers to The Grid! Congratulations on your launch - looking forward to seeing what happens with my little corner of the digital globe.
