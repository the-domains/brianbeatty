Wednesday, December 16, 2015\. Welcome to [The Grid][0].  
My number came up as next in line to be granted access to a new company that will help me create my own website with the assistance of artificial intelligence. 64,000 other nerds have also signed up. I've never been accused of being much of a geek...but the premise of The Grid has me pretty stoked, intrigued, and even a little apprehensive.  
Three cheers to The Grid! Congratulations on your launch. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens in my little corner of the digital globe.
