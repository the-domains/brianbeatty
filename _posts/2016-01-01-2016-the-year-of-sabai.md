I think I start every new year with proclamations to blog more, eat less, love more deeply, go the distance, yadda yadda yadda (and no, that is not a reference to a [Seinfeld][0] episode). My intentions are noble, it's my follow-through that is lacking. I recall my junior league pitching coach once told me the same thing. 

I am writing today from the beautiful coast of the Gulf of Thailand, between the towns of Cha-am and Hua Hin and have titled this blog post a fitting name, because I sense the need for 2016 to be a year of peace, calm, quiet resolve and hopeful intentions; SABAI. This Thai phrase was taught to me by my friend, Steve, who is a devout believer in the power of sabai and practices it as best he can. I first heard about it from him nearly 3 years ago and I think I finally know what he was talking about. And to practice it takes time and patience...that is why, when you finally get it, you say the phrase 2x together, to give it more emphasis..."sabai sabai". If you'd like to read more about it, click [here][1]. If you don't, it can be summed up by saying, "_It is wellness almost beyond words, the Thais' heaven on earth_."

I am hopeful for 2016 on so many levels. I feel that last year was filled with much self-discovery that helped me grow in many areas, but I also opened up doors into my heart that I frankly wish would have stayed closed and left alone. Maybe I'll write more on that later. No need to worry, it's all good.

So, here's to 2016\. Sabai Sabai (สบาย สบาย).****
